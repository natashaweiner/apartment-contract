# Apartments 721
# Property Management Contract 

# Requirements:
Must be able to handle a variable amount of participants

We have a mapping of uint256 (apartmentIDs) to addresses (owners) and a mapping of addresses (owners) to uint256 (number of apartments). This means we can have up to 2256 apartment owners.
Must have at least one payable function

transferFrom is a payable function that can be called by any individual. This function requires msg.value to be greater than or equal to 2 ether. This amount is to be used as collateral (see next point)

Must punish any dishonest participants in the contract

If _from argument in transferFrom does not match msg.sender or if the owner of the apartment is not _from, then nothing happens and the value sent belongs to the contract; otherwise, if the above conditions hold, then the 2 ether amount will be transferred back to _from (msg.sender)

Must disallow new participants after the contract is over/finished (if your contract has a terminal state)

The contract does not terminate since individuals should always be able to transfer their apartment to another individual that the contract has not seen before.
